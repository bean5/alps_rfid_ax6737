# alps_rfid_ax6737_example

Demonstrates how to use the alps_rfid_ax6737 plugin.

## ADB Uninstall example:
`adb uninstall com.amorenew.orange_rfid.alps_rfid_ax6737_example`

## Getting Started

Install `adb install -r build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

You cannot install/start app from VS Code because that uses 64 bit. Running "without debug" has a similar problem. Android Studio might work.
